==== Prepare your AWS account

1. If you don’t already have an AWS account, create one at https://aws.amazon.com by following the on-screen instructions.
2. Use the region selector in the navigation bar to choose the AWS Region where you want to deploy on AWS.
3. To create a Route 53 DNS entry, you need to provide the Hosted Zone ID of an existing Hosted Zone, if not provided the deployment will skip creation of DNS entry.
