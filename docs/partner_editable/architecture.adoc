Figure 1: Quick Start architecture for _{partner-product-name}_ on AWS

As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two/three Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* An Amazon Route 53 record entry for provided Hosted zone Id. (optional)
* An Amazon ACM public certificate for HTTPs connection. (optional)
* An AWS Web Application Firewall using AWS Managed WAF rules for protection against SQLInjection and common Wordpress exploits.
* An internet gateway to let traffic in the VPC.
* An ELB Application load balancer targeted to the ECS Cluster Auto scaling group.
* An RDS Aurora Serverless database connected to the Containers.
* An EFS File System for storing Wordpress files, themes and plugins.
* An AWS Secrets Manager secret to store the RDS Aurora database password.
* In the public subnets, managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets. 
* In the private subnets, ECS Fargate containers running Wordpress, which communicate with the Aurora serverless database and the Elastic Filesystem.
